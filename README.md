# GraphQL_Project

This project sets up a basic GraphQL server using Apollo Server. It showcases how to define a GraphQL schema, utilize mocks for development, and manage server operations efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system.

### Setup

#### 1. Initialize the Project
   Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y

#### 2. Install Dependencies
    Install necessary packages for development:
    npm install graphql apollo-server nodemon

#### 3. Configure Scripts
    In your package.json, add a script to start the server using nodemon. This enables automatic server restart upon file changes:
    "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon ."
    }

#### 4. Run the Server
Start your GraphQL server with:

npm start

Access the Apollo Servers GraphQL playground at http://localhost:4000/ to execute queries.

Testing Queries
Sample queries are provided in test_query.txt for testing in the GraphQL playground at http://localhost:4000/.

### Next Steps
Expand your GraphQL knowledge and explore integration with different technologies:
